# üìã Daily Diet
I developed this project as a challenge of my latest studies on Node lessons at [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br).

## üöÄ Techs and Tools
- [Node.js v18](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Fastify](https://fastify.dev)
- [Knex](https://knexjs.org/)
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) / [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

## üíª Project
This project was developed to practice the development of a API REST in Node.js with Fastify. It was applied E2E tests on routes using Vitest along with supertest to make requests. Knex was used as query builder alongside with SQLite database on development enviroment and PostgreSQL on production. 

To get started with the api flow, you'll have to create a new user before managing with the meals, this app hasn't a authentication system, so it will be used a simple cookie session to identify the active user (created during user creation).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
Setup enviroment variables and run:
```shell
npm i
npm run knex -- migrate:latest 
npm run dev
```

## üîó Routes
